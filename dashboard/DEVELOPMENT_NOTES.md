## 2024-10-30: Dashboard Chart Initialization Fixes

### Issues Identified
1. Chart initialization errors in browser console:
```
TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'labels')
```
This error occurs because we're trying to update chart data before the charts are properly initialized.

2. Missing error handling for chart updates and data validation
3. Race conditions between DOM loading and chart initialization
4. No proper cleanup of chart instances

### Solutions Implemented

1. **Chart Instance Management**
- Added global chart instance variables to track chart state
- Implemented proper chart cleanup and reinitialization
```javascript
let priceChart = null;
let volatilityChart = null;
let liquidityChart = null;
```

2. **DOM Element Validation**
- Added checks for chart canvas elements before initialization
- Improved error handling with detailed logging
```javascript
const ctx = document.getElementById('dexPriceChart')?.getContext('2d');
if (!ctx) return;
```

3. **Data Validation**
- Added type checking for incoming data
- Implemented safe array access with null checks
- Added error boundaries around chart updates

4. **Chart Initialization Logic**
- Charts are now initialized only when:
  - DOM is fully loaded
  - Canvas elements are available
  - Data is valid and properly formatted
- Each chart has its own error handling and logging

5. **Performance Optimizations**
- Using requestAnimationFrame for smooth updates
- Throttling data requests to prevent overwhelming the server
- Caching chart instances to prevent memory leaks

### Error Handling Strategy
1. Each chart update function has its own try-catch block
2. Errors are logged with specific context
3. Failed updates don't crash the entire dashboard
4. Users are notified of errors through console messages

### Monitoring Added
- Added logging for chart initialization
- Added logging for data updates
- Added logging for error conditions
- Added connection status monitoring

### Next Steps
1. Implement user-visible error notifications
2. Add data validation on the server side
3. Consider adding chart reinitialization on errors
4. Add performance monitoring for chart updates

### Testing Notes
- Charts successfully initialize after DOM load
- Data updates are smooth and error-free
- Memory usage is stable
- No console errors during normal operation

### Code Structure
The chart initialization and update logic follows this pattern:
1. Check for DOM element
2. Validate data
3. Initialize chart if needed
4. Update data with error handling
5. Log any issues

This provides a robust foundation for future dashboard enhancements while maintaining stability and performance.
