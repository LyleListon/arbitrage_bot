# Progress Summary

## Current Status
- We are currently in the dashboard directory: `C:\Users\listonianapp\Desktop\arbitrage_bot\dashboard`
- The arbitrage bot is running in a separate terminal with the command: `python -m scripts.arbitrage_bot --network holesky`

## What's Been Done
1. Updated dependencies in the main `requirements.txt` file.
2. Installed updated dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade`.
3. Navigated to the dashboard directory.
4. Confirmed the presence of `app.py` and other dashboard-related files.

## Next Steps
1. Activate the virtual environment. The command for this may vary depending on your setup, but it's likely one of these:
   - Windows: `venv_py311\Scripts\activate`
   - Unix or MacOS: `source venv_py311/bin/activate`
2. Once the virtual environment is activated, run the Flask application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
3. If the Flask app runs successfully, you should be able to access the dashboard by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5000` (or whatever port the app specifies).

## Potential Issues to Address
1. Ensure all required dependencies for the dashboard are installed in the virtual environment.
2. If there are any import errors when running `app.py`, you may need to add the project root to the Python path or adjust import statements.
3. Make sure the `arbitrage_bot.db` file (if used by the dashboard) is accessible and up-to-date.

## Notes
- The arbitrage bot is currently running and logging warnings about low success rate and daily profit. These may need to be addressed in the bot's logic or configuration.
- The dashboard implementation (app.py) hasn't been tested yet, so there might be additional issues or required setup steps that we haven't encountered.

Good luck with the next steps, and don't hesitate to review the code and logs if you encounter any issues!
