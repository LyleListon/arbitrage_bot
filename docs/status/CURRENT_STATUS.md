- Dashboard updated with new contract addresses
- Monitoring system tracking both factory and router trades
- ABIs updated to reflect latest changes

## Next Steps

1. Monitor system performance with new contracts
2. Analyze quote accuracy and gas estimates
3. Consider adding more token pairs if needed
4. Fine-tune parameters based on real usage data
5. Prepare for mainnet deployment
