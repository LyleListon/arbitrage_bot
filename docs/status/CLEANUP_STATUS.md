- Moving toward mainnet deployment
- Configuration system has been completely reorganized
- Documentation structure now follows clear organization

## Recent Improvements

1. Configuration System

## Migration Notes

To migrate to the new configuration system:
1. Copy local.template.json to local.json
2. Fill in private keys and addresses
3. Use config_loader.py to load configurations
4. Update any scripts to use the new config structure
