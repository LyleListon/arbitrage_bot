# Swap Implementation Status

## Latest Investigation Results

### Pool States (Updated)

1. 0.05% Fee Pool:
   - Address: 0x3289680dD4d6C10bb19b899729cda5eEF58AEfF1
   - Liquidity: 73538001811619 units
   - Current tick: 180753
   - Price: ~5603.97 USDC per ETH
   - Tick initialization: Both bounds uninitialized
   - Status: Pool unlocked

2. 0.3% Fee Pool (Most Liquid):
   - Address: 0x6Ce0896eAE6D4BD668fDe41BB784548fb8F59b50
   - Liquidity: 193301456200179 units
   - Current tick: 180668
   - Price: ~5556.50 USDC per ETH
   - Tick initialization: Lower initialized, upper not
   - Status: Pool unlocked

3. 1% Fee Pool:
   - Address: 0x6418EEC70f50913ff0d756B48d32Ce7C02b47C47
   - Liquidity: 25535452969347 units
   - Current tick: 180560
   - Price: ~5497.20 USDC per ETH
   - Tick initialization: Both bounds uninitialized
   - Status: Pool unlocked

### Critical Issues

1. Tick Initialization:
   - Most tick ranges are uninitialized
   - Only 0.3% pool has lower tick initialized
   - May affect swap path calculation

2. Price Oracle Issues:
   - All pools show reasonable prices
   - But quoter system still non-functional
   - Suggests issue with oracle implementation

3. Swap Failures:
   - Transactions confirm but no balance changes
   - Direct pool interactions revert
   - Affects all fee tiers despite liquidity

### Token States
- WETH Balance: 0.699933341332273263
- USDC Balance: 1.0
- All approvals set to MAX
- Basic token transfers work

### Failed Approaches

1. Router-based Swaps
   - SwapRouter (0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564)
   - SwapRouter02 (0x68b3465833fb72A70ecDF485E0e4C7bD8665Fc45)
   - All fee tiers attempted
   - Transactions confirm but no balance changes

2. Price Quoter
   - All quote attempts fail
   - Both single-hop and path-based quotes fail
   - Suggests oracle/price feed issues

3. Direct Pool Interaction
   - Attempted direct pool.swap() call
   - Transaction reverts
   - Confirms issue is at pool level

### Root Cause Analysis

1. Pool Implementation
   - Pools exist and accept liquidity
   - Basic functions (slot0, token addresses) work
   - Swap function reverts consistently
   - Uninitialized ticks may be blocking swaps

2. Price Oracle
   - Cannot get quotes for any amount
   - Suggests fundamental price feed issue
   - May affect swap calculations

3. Token Implementation
   - Both tokens work for basic operations
   - Approvals work correctly
   - Transfer functions work

### Recommendations

1. Immediate Actions
   - Focus on tick initialization
   - Consider implementing fallback DEX options
   - Document issues for Uniswap team

2. Development Path
   - Set up local testnet for development
   - Use mainnet fork for testing
   - Consider alternative DEX protocols

3. Testing Strategy
   - Test on multiple networks
   - Use local fork for initial testing
   - Maintain test suite across different DEXes

### Next Steps
1. Investigate tick initialization impact
2. Test with smaller amounts within initialized ranges
3. Consider implementing tick initialization before swaps
4. Set up local testnet environment for debugging
