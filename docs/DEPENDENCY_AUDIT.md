# Dependency Audit Report

## Overview
Comprehensive analysis of system dependencies, highlighting coupling, potential refactoring opportunities, and dependency management strategies.

## Dependency Categories

### 1. Blockchain Interaction Dependencies
- **Web3 Libraries**
  - Current: Direct Web3 library imports
  - Issues: Tight coupling with specific blockchain implementations
  - Recommendation: Create abstraction layer

### 2. Machine Learning Dependencies
- **ML Frameworks**
  - Current: Direct PyTorch, TensorFlow imports
  - Issues: Model-specific implementations
  - Recommendation: Create model interface, support pluggable ML backends

### 3. Trading Execution Dependencies
- **DEX Interaction**
  - Current: Direct router and factory contract interactions
  - Issues: Network-specific implementations
  - Recommendation: Create generic DEX interaction interface

## Dependency Complexity Analysis

## Refactoring Recommendations

1. **Abstraction Layers**
   - Create interface-based dependency management
   - Implement dependency injection
   - Support dynamic component swapping

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - Use centralized dependency container
   - Support singleton and factory patterns
   - Enable loose coupling

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Externalize dependency configurations
   - Support environment-based dependency selection
   - Create flexible initialization mechanisms

## Dependency Reduction Strategies

### Short-Term
- Create abstract base classes
- Implement dependency injection container
- Reduce direct imports

### Medium-Term
- Develop plugin architecture
- Create comprehensive dependency interfaces
- Implement dynamic loading mechanisms

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Dependency abstraction
- **Medium Risk**: Interface standardization
- **High Risk**: Complete system refactoring

## Next Steps
1. Implement dependency injection framework
2. Create abstract interfaces
3. Develop dependency configuration system
4. Incrementally refactor existing components

## Detailed Dependency Breakdown

### Blockchain Dependencies
- **Current State**: 
  - Direct Web3 library usage
  - Network-specific contract interactions
- **Proposed Solution**:
  ```python
  class BlockchainAdapter(ABC):
      @abstractmethod
      def connect(self, network: str) -> Any:
          pass
      
      @abstractmethod
      def execute_transaction(self, transaction: Dict) -> Any:
          pass
  ```

### Machine Learning Dependencies
- **Current State**:
  - Hardcoded ML model implementations
  - Framework-specific training logic
- **Proposed Solution**:
  ```python
  class MLModelInterface(ABC):
      @abstractmethod
      def train(self, data: Any) -> Any:
          pass
      
      @abstractmethod
      def predict(self, input_data: Any) -> Any:
          pass
  ```

### Trading Execution Dependencies
- **Current State**:
  - Tightly coupled trade execution logic
  - Limited abstraction for different DEX interactions
- **Proposed Solution**:
  ```python
  class TradeExecutionStrategy(ABC):
      @abstractmethod
      def validate_opportunity(self, opportunity: Dict) -> bool:
          pass
      
      @abstractmethod
      def execute_trade(self, opportunity: Dict) -> Any:
          pass
  ```

## Conclusion
Strategic dependency management can significantly improve system flexibility, testability, and maintainability. The proposed approach creates a more modular, adaptable architecture that supports future enhancements and reduces technical debt.
