# Project Handoff Documentation

## Current State

1. Successfully connected to Base network via Infura endpoint
2. Successfully querying ETH/USDC pool price data
3. Implemented price impact calculations
4. Implemented basic arbitrage opportunity detection

## Outstanding Issues

1. Volatility calculation error:
   - Current error: "unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow(): 'decimal.Decimal' and 'float'"
   - Need to ensure all numeric operations use Decimal type consistently
   - Consider alternative volatility calculation methods that avoid power operations

2. Contract interaction errors for some pools:
   - Most pool addresses are returning "Could not transact with/call contract function"
   - Need to verify pool addresses and contract interfaces
   - Consider implementing retry logic for failed contract calls

3. Price display issue:
   - Currently showing $0.00 for prices
   - Need to verify price calculation and formatting
   - May need to adjust decimal places in price conversion

## Recent Changes

1. Updated RPC endpoint to use Infura:
   ```python
   infura_url = "https://base-mainnet.infura.io/v3/863c326dab1a444dba3f41ae7a07ccce"
   ```

2. Verified working pool:
   - ETH/USDC 0.05% pool: `0x4C36388bE6F416A29C8d8Eee81C771cE6bE14B18`

3. Implemented price monitoring with:
   - Price updates
   - Price change calculation
   - Price impact estimation
   - Basic volatility tracking (needs fixing)

## Next Steps

1. Fix volatility calculation:
   - Review all numeric operations in get_volatility()
   - Consider using a simpler volatility calculation method
   - Ensure consistent use of Decimal type

2. Fix price display:
   - Review price calculation in get_token_price()
   - Verify decimal place handling
   - Add proper price formatting

3. Improve pool contract interactions:
   - Verify pool addresses for all trading pairs
   - Add error handling and retry logic
   - Consider implementing pool status checks

4. Enhance price monitoring:
   - Add more sophisticated arbitrage detection
   - Implement volume tracking
   - Add historical price analysis

5. Testing and validation:
   - Add unit tests for price calculations
   - Implement integration tests for contract interactions
   - Add error handling test cases

## Additional Notes

1. The test_infura_base.py script successfully connects to Base network and queries the ETH/USDC pool
2. The price_analysis.py module needs careful review of all numeric operations
3. Consider implementing a more robust error handling system for contract interactions
4. Price calculation shows correct changes but wrong absolute values

## Dependencies

- web3.py for blockchain interaction
- decimal for precise numeric calculations
- logging for error tracking
- collections.deque for price history

## Configuration

Current Infura endpoint: https://base-mainnet.infura.io/v3/863c326dab1a444dba3f41ae7a07ccce

## Testing

To verify Base network connectivity and pool interaction:
```python
python test_infura_base.py
```

To monitor prices:
```python
python run_price_monitor.py
```

## Key Areas for Next Assistant

1. Price Calculation Fix:
   - Review sqrtPriceX96 to price conversion
   - Verify decimal place handling
   - Add proper price formatting

2. Volatility Calculation:
   - Implement alternative volatility calculation
   - Ensure consistent Decimal usage
   - Add validation checks

3. Pool Contract Interactions:
   - Verify and update pool addresses
   - Implement retry mechanism
   - Add connection status checks

# Arbitrage Bot Handoff Notes

## Running the Bot
```bash
python arbitrage_bot.py
```

Make sure you have:
1. All required dependencies installed (from requirements.txt)
2. Valid .env.mainnet file with:
   - BASE_RPC_URL
   - PRIVATE_KEY
   - Other configuration parameters

## Current Status (2024-12-04)
- Bot is actively monitoring WETH/USDC prices on Base
- Finding opportunities with ~0.27% price differences (10 USDC spread)
- Configured for minimum profit of 3 USDC per trade
- Gas costs averaging 0.03 USDC
- Price impacts well controlled at 0.6-0.8%

## Recent Changes
- Implemented complete arbitrage execution logic
- Added proper balance and allowance checks
- Improved price impact calculations
- Lowered minimum profit threshold to 3 USDC
- Added comprehensive logging and performance tracking

## Configuration
- MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD: 0.2%
- MIN_PROFIT_USDC: 3.0
- MAX_PRICE_IMPACT: 2%
- MAX_SLIPPAGE: 0.2%
- TEST_AMOUNT_WETH: 0.5
- TEST_AMOUNT_USDC: 2000

## Current Market Conditions
- WETH/USDC price range: 1853-1856 USDC
- Gas prices stable and low
- Liquidity sufficient for current test amounts

## Next Steps
- Monitor initial trades for successful execution
- Fine-tune profit thresholds based on performance
- Consider adjusting test amounts if needed
- Implement additional error recovery mechanisms if required

## Notes
- Bot is running with proper error handling and graceful shutdown
- All critical paths are logged for monitoring
- Performance metrics are being tracked and reported
- Logs are written to arbitrage.log for debugging
