# Project Handoff Status

## Latest Updates
- Cleaned up repository by removing VS Code files from git tracking
- Updated .gitignore to properly exclude IDE-specific files
- Successfully merged and pushed all changes to GitHub
- GitHub reported 37 security vulnerabilities that need attention (14 high, 15 moderate, 8 low)

### Current Focus
1. Testing environment on Arbitrum Goerli
2. Security improvements needed:
   - Review and update dependencies to address reported vulnerabilities
   - Consider enabling Dependabot for automated security updates

### Next Steps
1. Address security vulnerabilities reported by GitHub:
   - Review Dependabot alerts at https://github.com/LyleListon/arbitrage_bot/security/dependabot
   - Update vulnerable dependencies to secure versions
2. Continue with Arbitrum Goerli testing:
   - Get testnet ETH from Arbitrum Goerli faucets
   - Use wrap_eth_arbitrum.js to convert ETH to WETH
   - Run check_arbitrum_pools.js to verify Uniswap V3 setup
3. Monitor and optimize gas usage
4. Prepare for mainnet deployment

### Key Addresses (Arbitrum Goerli)
- WETH: 0xe39Ab88f8A4777030A534146A9Ca3B52bd5D43A3
- USDC: 0x8FB1E3fC51F3b789dED7557E680551d93Ea9d892
- Uniswap V3 Factory: 0x4893376342d5D7b3e31d4184c08b265e5aB2A3f6

### Testing Strategy
1. Verify token balances and pool liquidity
2. Test single-hop arbitrage opportunities
3. Implement multi-hop strategies
4. Optimize gas usage and execution speed
5. Document successful paths for mainnet

### Documentation

- Document successful arbitrage paths
- Monitor pool liquidity and price movements
- Keep track of transaction costs

### Mainnet Preparation
1. Complete Arbitrum Goerli testing
2. Audit gas usage and optimization
3. Document profitable paths
4. Prepare mainnet deployment strategy
5. Set up monitoring and alerts
