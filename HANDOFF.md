# Project Handoff Documentation

## Current State

1. Successfully connected to Base network via Infura endpoint
2. Successfully querying ETH/USDC pool price data
3. Implemented price impact calculations
4. Implemented basic arbitrage opportunity detection

## Outstanding Issues

1. Volatility calculation error:
   - Current error: "unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow(): 'decimal.Decimal' and 'float'"
   - Need to ensure all numeric operations use Decimal type consistently
   - Consider alternative volatility calculation methods that avoid power operations

2. Contract interaction errors for some pools:
   - Most pool addresses are returning "Could not transact with/call contract function"
   - Need to verify pool addresses and contract interfaces
   - Consider implementing retry logic for failed contract calls

3. Price display issue:
   - Currently showing $0.00 for prices
   - Need to verify price calculation and formatting
   - May need to adjust decimal places in price conversion

## Recent Changes

1. Updated RPC endpoint to use Infura:
   ```python
   infura_url = "https://base-mainnet.infura.io/v3/863c326dab1a444dba3f41ae7a07ccce"
   ```

2. Verified working pool:
   - ETH/USDC 0.05% pool: `0x4C36388bE6F416A29C8d8Eee81C771cE6bE14B18`

3. Implemented price monitoring with:
   - Price updates
   - Price change calculation
   - Price impact estimation
   - Basic volatility tracking (needs fixing)

## Next Steps

1. Fix volatility calculation:
   - Review all numeric operations in get_volatility()
   - Consider using a simpler volatility calculation method
   - Ensure consistent use of Decimal type

2. Fix price display:
   - Review price calculation in get_token_price()
   - Verify decimal place handling
   - Add proper price formatting

3. Improve pool contract interactions:
   - Verify pool addresses for all trading pairs
   - Add error handling and retry logic
   - Consider implementing pool status checks

4. Enhance price monitoring:
   - Add more sophisticated arbitrage detection
   - Implement volume tracking
   - Add historical price analysis

5. Testing and validation:
   - Add unit tests for price calculations
   - Implement integration tests for contract interactions
   - Add error handling test cases

## Additional Notes

1. The test_infura_base.py script successfully connects to Base network and queries the ETH/USDC pool
2. The price_analysis.py module needs careful review of all numeric operations
3. Consider implementing a more robust error handling system for contract interactions
4. Price calculation shows correct changes but wrong absolute values

## Dependencies

- web3.py for blockchain interaction
- decimal for precise numeric calculations
- logging for error tracking
- collections.deque for price history

## Configuration

Current Infura endpoint: https://base-mainnet.infura.io/v3/863c326dab1a444dba3f41ae7a07ccce

## Testing

To verify Base network connectivity and pool interaction:
```python
python test_infura_base.py
```

To monitor prices:
```python
python run_price_monitor.py
```

## Key Areas for Next Assistant

1. Price Calculation Fix:
   - Review sqrtPriceX96 to price conversion
   - Verify decimal place handling
   - Add proper price formatting

2. Volatility Calculation:
   - Implement alternative volatility calculation
   - Ensure consistent Decimal usage
   - Add validation checks

3. Pool Contract Interactions:
   - Verify and update pool addresses
   - Implement retry mechanism
   - Add connection status checks
