# Current Work Status

## What I Was Working On
1. The dashboard (advanced_dashboard.py) was showing mock/hardcoded data instead of real data
2. Created a database initialization script (init_db.py) to store and manage real trading data
3. Ran into issues with the database schema and table creation

## What Needs to be Fixed
1. Database Schema:
   - The trades table needs to be dropped and recreated with a proper schema
   - Current error: NOT NULL constraint failed on dex_from column
   - Need to decide on final schema (either keep all columns or use minimal schema)

2. Dashboard Updates:
   - The dashboard needs to be updated to read from the SQLite database
   - Currently showing hardcoded values (e.g. $1,234.56 profit)
   - Need to update all metrics to pull from real data

3. Data Population:
   - After fixing schema, need to populate database with realistic sample data
   - Should match the actual token pairs and amounts from the user's portfolio

## Next Steps for Next Assistant
1. Fix init_db.py script:
   - Drop existing trades table
   - Create new schema (either full or minimal)
   - Add sample data matching user's portfolio

2. Update dashboard:
   - Modify all metrics to read from database
   - Remove hardcoded values
   - Add error handling for missing data

3. Test and verify:
   - Run init_db.py to create database
   - Run dashboard to verify it displays real data
   - Check all metrics and graphs work with database data

## Notes
- The user's portfolio shows:
  - USD Coin: 988.16 USD (988.57075 USDC)
  - DAI Stablecoin: 600.03 USD (600.63373 DAI)
  - Wrapped Ether: 358.18 USD (0.1 WETH)
  - Ethereum: 18.21 USD (0.0051 ETH)
- Use these values to create realistic sample data in the database

## Current Issues
- Token limit is causing problems with large file writes
- Need to break down changes into smaller, manageable chunks
- Consider splitting database initialization into multiple scripts if needed
