# Assistant Progress Tracking

## Current Task Overview
- **Date**: November 27, 2024
- **Current Focus**: Fixing Price Data Display in Dashboard
- **Status**: In Progress - Price Calculation Issues

## Latest Work
- Fixed WETH/USDC price display (now showing correct ~3035 USDC per ETH)
- Fixed USDC/DAI price display (now showing correct ~0.986 DAI per USDC)
- Identified issue with WETH/DAI price calculation:
  ```
  WETH/DAI raw price: 918.09674660540948321 DAI per ETH
  DAI/USDC ratio: 0.983062
  ```
  The price is too low because we're dividing by the DAI/USDC ratio when we should be multiplying.

## Next Steps for Future Assistant
1. Fix WETH/DAI price calculation in get_token_price method:
   - Current code divides by DAI/USDC ratio
   - Should multiply instead (since DAI is worth 0.983062 USDC)
   - Expected result should be ~3000 DAI per ETH (similar to WETH/USDC)
   - Change this line:
     ```python
     price = raw_price / dai_usdc_price  # Wrong
     price = raw_price * dai_usdc_price  # Should be this
     ```

2. After fixing WETH/DAI price:
   - Test all price pairs again
   - Verify WETH/USDC shows ~3035 USDC per ETH
   - Verify WETH/DAI shows similar price in DAI terms
   - Verify USDC/DAI shows ~0.986 DAI per USDC

3. If Aerodrome still fails:
   - Consider adding more routing paths (e.g., through intermediate tokens)
   - Or try different fee tiers (500, 3000, 10000)
   - Or try querying pool contracts directly

## Current Issues
- WETH/DAI price showing ~933 when it should be ~3035
- Aerodrome price queries failing with "execution reverted"
- Need to handle DAI/USDC ratio correctly in price calculations

## Notes and Observations
- BaseSwap prices are working for WETH/USDC and USDC/DAI
- DAI is trading slightly below peg (0.983062 USDC)
- Need to account for this peg difference in WETH/DAI calculations

## Communication Log
- Successfully fixed WETH/USDC price display
- Successfully fixed USDC/DAI price display
- Identified issue with WETH/DAI price calculation
- Added detailed logging for price adjustments

## Recommended Focus
1. Fix the WETH/DAI price calculation first
2. Then tackle Aerodrome integration if time permits
3. Add more validation and error handling

## Code Sections to Update
```python
# In get_token_price method, update this section:
elif token_in == 'WETH' and token_out == 'DAI':
    # For WETH/DAI, convert to DAI terms and adjust for DAI/USDC ratio
    raw_price = Decimal(amounts_out[1]) / Decimal(10 ** decimals_out)
    dai_usdc_price = self.get_token_price(dex, 'DAI', 'USDC')
    if dai_usdc_price:
        # Change this line:
        price = raw_price / dai_usdc_price  # Wrong
        # To this:
        price = raw_price * dai_usdc_price  # Correct
```

The next assistant should focus on fixing the WETH/DAI price calculation by multiplying by the DAI/USDC ratio instead of dividing by it. This should bring the WETH/DAI price in line with the WETH/USDC price.
